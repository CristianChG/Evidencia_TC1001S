This code implements a memory game of number pairs using the Turtle library in Python. The objective of the game is to find all the pairs of numbers hidden under the white tiles. The player clicks on the tiles to reveal the numbers, and if they find a matching pair, the tiles remain visible. The game continues until all pairs have been found, and a victory message is displayed.

The game uses simple images and graphics to create an attractive visual interface. It also keeps track of the number of attempts (taps) made by the player and displays this count in the console along with a victory message when the puzzle is solved.

To play, the user simply clicks on the tiles to reveal the numbers underneath and tries to remember their locations to find matching pairs. It's a fun game to exercise memory and concentration.

For this challenge, a function was implemented to count the total number of taps made by the user in a game, using the onscreenclick() function. Subsequently, a function was implemented to detect when the user has finished solving the game.
